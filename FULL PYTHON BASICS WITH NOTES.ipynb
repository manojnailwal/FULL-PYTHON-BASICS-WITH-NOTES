    "### **Chapter 3: Python Syntax and Code Structure, Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Python Syntax and Code Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indentation:**\n",
    "  - Python relies on indentation to define the structure of the code, such as loops, functions, and conditionals.\n",
    "  - **Indentation** is used instead of curly braces `{}` to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "  - Proper indentation (spaces or tabs) is crucial in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if 10 > 5:\n",
    "      print(\"10 is greater than 5\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - The block of code after the `if` statement is indented, indicating that it belongs to that conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comments:**\n",
    "  - Comments in Python are used for explaining the code. They are preceded by a hash symbol (`#`).\n",
    "  - Python ignores comments during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # This is a comment explaining the next line of code\n",
    "  print(\"Hello, World!\")  # This will print a greeting message\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Block Structure:**\n",
    "  - A **code block** in Python is defined by its indentation level, which indicates grouping of statements.\n",
    "  - Code blocks are used in conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for i in range(5):\n",
    "      print(i)  # This is inside the loop and will execute for each value of i\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity:**\n",
    "  - Python is case-sensitive, meaning that `variable` and `Variable` are considered different.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = 10\n",
    "  A = 20\n",
    "  print(a)  # Output: 10\n",
    "  print(A)  # Output: 20\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is a Variable?**\n",
    "  - A **variable** is a name used to store a value in Python.\n",
    "  - In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; it is inferred from the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = 5  # Integer\n",
    "  name = \"Alice\"  # String\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you can reassign a variable to a different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Data Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **String (str):**\n",
    "    - Used to store text or a sequence of characters.\n",
    "    - Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    name = \"John\"\n",
    "    greeting = 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Integer (int):**\n",
    "    - Used to store whole numbers (positive or negative).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = 25\n",
    "    year = -2024\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Float (float):**\n",
    "    - Used to store decimal numbers or numbers with fractional parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    temperature = 98.6\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Boolean (bool):**\n",
    "    - Used to store `True` or `False` values.\n",
    "    - Often used in conditional statements and logic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    is_sunny = True\n",
    "    is_raining = False\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **List:**\n",
    "    - An ordered, mutable collection of elements.\n",
    "    - Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Tuple:**\n",
    "    - Similar to a list but immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n",
    "    - Tuples are defined using parentheses `( )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    coordinates = (10, 20)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Dictionary (dict):**\n",
    "    - A collection of key-value pairs.\n",
    "    - Defined using curly braces `{ }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    person = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Set:**\n",
    "    - An unordered collection of unique elements.\n",
    "    - Defined using curly braces `{ }`, but without key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Conversion:**\n",
    "  - You can convert between different data types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Convert string to integer:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    num_str = \"100\"\n",
    "    num = int(num_str)\n",
    "    print(num)  # Output: 100\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Convert integer to string:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = 25\n",
    "    age_str = str(age)\n",
    "    print(age_str)  # Output: \"25\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:**\n",
    "  - Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is determined at runtime.\n",
    "  - You can assign a variable a different type during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  var = 10  # Integer\n",
    "  var = \"Now I'm a string!\"  # Reassigned to string type\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python syntax relies heavily on indentation to organize code, and comments are used for clarity.\n",
    "- Variables are used to store values, and Python supports various data types such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "- Python is dynamically typed, allowing variables to hold different types of data at different points in time.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Reading Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides various ways to open and read files. The most common methods include `open()`, `read()`, and `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`open()` Function**:\n",
    "This function is used to open a file, and it requires the file path and mode as arguments. The common file modes are:\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read mode (default).\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write mode.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append mode.\n",
    "- `'r+'`: Read and write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opening a file in read mode\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading the entire content of the file\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the file after reading\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`read()` Method**:\n",
    "The `read()` method reads the entire file content into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading the entire content of a file\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Python allows you to write data to files using `write()` and `writelines()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`write()` Method**:\n",
    "The `write()` method writes a string to a file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten (in \"write\" mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "file.close()  # Ensure the file is saved and closed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`writelines()` Method**:\n",
    "The `writelines()` method writes a list of strings to a file. Each string in the list will be written as a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines_to_write = [\"First line\\n\", \"Second line\\n\", \"Third line\\n\"]\n",

    "### **3. File Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "When opening a file, you specify a mode that determines how you can interact with the file. The most common modes are:\n",
    "- **`'r'`**: Read mode (default). The file must exist.\n",
    "- **`'w'`**: Write mode. If the file exists, it is overwritten. If not, a new file is created.\n",
    "- **`'a'`**: Append mode. Data is written to the end of the file.\n",
    "- **`'r+'`**: Read and write mode. The file must exist.\n",

    "### **Important Points to Remember**:\n",
    "1. Always close the file after performing operations using `file.close()` or use a context manager (`with` statement) for automatic closing.\n",
    "2. Use `'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing (overwrites), `'a'` for appending, and `'r+'` for reading and writing.\n",
    "3. To read all content, use `read()`, and to read line by line, use `readlines()`.\n",

    "### **Chapter 13: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. It allows you to model real-world entities and interactions in your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Classes and Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. An **object** is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Defining a class\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Attributes\n",
    "    breed = \"Labrador\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the method and attribute\n",
    "print(dog1.breed)  # Output: Labrador\n",
    "dog1.speak()       # Output: Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Attributes and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes**: These are variables that hold the state of an object. They are usually defined within the class.\n",
    "- **Methods**: These are functions defined within the class that define the behavior of the objects created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Attributes\n",
    "    brand = \"Toyota\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Method\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Driving the car.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object\n",
    "car1 = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing an attribute and method\n",
    "print(car1.brand)  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "car1.drive()       # Output: Driving the car.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. `__init__` Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method called a **constructor**. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        # Initialize attributes\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hi, I am {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object with attributes\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"John\", 25)\n",
    "person1.introduce()  # Output: Hi, I am John and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### **4. Inheritance and Polymorphism (Intro Level)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It helps in code reuse and establishing a relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Inheritance):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheriting from Animal class\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating object of Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog()\n",
    "dog1.speak()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** refers to the ability to use a method in different ways based on the object calling it. In the example above, both `Animal` and `Dog` have a `speak()` method, but the output differs based on the type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Classes and Objects**: Classes define the structure; objects are instances of classes.\n",
    "- **Attributes and Methods**: Attributes represent the state of an object; methods define its behavior.\n",
    "- **`__init__` Method**: Initializes the object’s attributes when it is created.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: The ability to redefine methods in subclasses for specific behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP provides better organization, code reuse, and modularity in Python programming, making it a powerful approach for solving complex problems."
